Blending sonic and visual inspiration under the name Xero, later Hybrid Theory, before finally settling on LINKIN PARK, Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, Brad Delson, Joseph Hahn, Rob Bourdon, and Dave “Phoenix” Farrell had no idea they were about to become the biggest rock band of their generation. In 2000, they released their first full-length, Hybrid Theory. Certified Diamond, it became “the bestselling debut of the 21st century.” Seven seminal albums followed: Meteora, Collision Course, Minutes To Midnight, A Thousand Suns, LIVING THINGS, The Hunting Party, and One More Light. LINKIN PARK has received multiple GRAMMY Awards, sold over 100 million albums worldwide, and notched five #1 Billboard debuts.

            After the tragic loss of Bennington in 2017, the band came to a devastating halt; their future obscured by grief and unanswered questions. Friendships led the way. Mike, Brad, Phoenix, and Joe began making music together again. They met Emily Armstrong and Colin Brittain, jam sessions organically morphed into recording, and LP quietly crafted a collection of songs channeling the open-hearted spontaneity of starting over: FROM ZERO. Earning some of the highest critical praise of their career, FROM ZERO peaked at #1 in 14 countries, igniting the triumphant FROM ZERO WORLD TOUR and LINKIN PARK’s continuing artistic evolution.">

            <div class="element-show" data-description='Juno Award-winning Canadian rock outfit Sum 41 balances energetic pop-punk and thrashing metal, a sound evolved over the decades as the once-playful crew grew into hardened scene elders. They hit the worldwide radar in 1996 after their hometown of Ajax, Ontario, proved unable to fully contain the foursomes early mixture of arena-sized riffing, hip-hop poses, and crass humor. Their breakthrough major-label debut, 2001s All Killer No Filler, featured the chart-topping MTV hit "Fat Lip" and its follow-up "In Too Deep." From there, the bands mischievous pop-punk style was steadily hardened with darker, world-weary lyrics and a heavier, metal-inspired attack. By the time their double-platinum third effort, Chuck, landed in 2004, the bands metallic tendencies were at the fore. Lineup changes and health problems sidelined the band in the 2010s, but they made a successful comeback with the well-received 13 Voices (2016) and Order in Decline (2019). In 2023, Sum 41 announced they would officially disband after touring to support their 2024 double LP Heaven :x: Hell.

            In addition to vocalist/guitarist Whibley, the band also originally included guitarist/vocalist Dave Baksh, bassist Cone McCaslin, and drummer Steve Jocz. Wooed by the boys goofy antics and incendiary live show (and excited about the prospect of promoting their very own ),  put Sum 41 on the payroll in 1999. The Half Hour of Power EP followed, and Warped Tour dates put the word out. They returned in 2000 with the fun-filled full-length All Killer No Filler, and the singles "In Too Deep" and "Fat Lip" became staples of both modern rock radio and Total Request Live. An extensive tour followed, and Sum 41 enjoyed their success the way all near-teenage boys would, with plenty of towel-snapping, groupie-loving, and self-deprecating low-ball humor. In 2002, they returned to wax with Does This Look Infected? While the album was a bit harder-edged, it found the band as excited as ever to mix punk-pop business with sophomoric pleasure: The video for "Hell Song" featured the guys acting out a sort of rock-star, debauched cage match with the aid of a few celebrity action figures. , Jesus Christ, and  all made appearances in the hilarious clip.
            
            It was not all fun and games, however, as Sum 41 was involved with the charity group War Child Canada, and the helped make a 2004 documentary covering the effects of war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Five days into filming, fighting and gunfire suddenly erupted around them, and they barely escaped -- these events led to 2004s slightly more mature and serious effort, Chuck, named for the UN aid worker, Chuck Pelletier, who was instrumental in getting them to safety. The DVD Rocked: Sum 41 in Congo was released at the end of 2005, and the live album Go Chuck Yourself appeared the following March.
            
            Guitarist Dave Baksh left the band during the spring of 2006 due to creative differences, going on to form the metal-punk outfit . Sum 41 continued as a trio, and their first album as such, Underclass Hero, appeared in July 2007. They eventually returned to being a quartet, replacing Baksh with guitarist Tom Thacker, and began to work on a new album. Screaming Bloody Murder appeared in March 2011. "Blood in My Eyes," a single from the album, was nominated for a Grammy that year. However, due to a series of back injuries for Whibley (and other issues that would soon come to light), Sum 41 would not return with new material for half a decade, despite their critical success.
            
            During the break, Jocz left the band and was replaced by Frank Zummo. Baksh also returned to the fold just in time for Sum 41 comeback in 2016. The group signed with  and embarked on an international tour that included stops in China and a stint on that summers Warped Tour. Their sixth LP, 13 Voices, featured the lead single Fake My Own Death" and became their third highest-charting release in their native Canada, peaking just outside the Top 20 in the U.S. During promotion for the album, Whibley revealed that he had been in an alcohol-related induced coma during the bands hiatus in 2014. While recovery included learning to walk and play guitar again, Whibley contributed a large part of his healing to the writing process of 13 Voices. To coincide with the albums release, the band embarked on an international tour dubbed "Dont Call It a Sum-Back."
            
            After setting out on another trek to celebrate the 15th anniversary of their breakthrough, they returned to the studio. Their seventh set, Order in Decline, arrived in the summer of 2019. Intensely political and pulling no punches with their message, the album included the tracks Out for Blood, 45 (A Matter of Time), and The New Sensation," borrowing from , , and even  on a series of rallying cries aimed at waking up a society on the brink of moral collapse. In 2022, the band announced that their next album, the sprawling double LP Heaven :x: Hell, would be evenly split between nostalgic pop-punk and metal. It would also be their last album, as Sum 41 would officially cease operations following an international tour supporting the effort. "Landmines," the first single from the release, appeared in 2023; following "Rise Up" and "Waiting on a Twist of Fate," the album landed in March 2024. ~ Johnny Loftus & Neil Z. Yeung, Rovi'>

            <div class="element-show" data-description="Emerging as a trailblazing name in the mid-'90s emo scene, Jimmy Eat World eventually found a larger audience by embracing a blend of alternative rock and power pop that targeted the heart as well as the head. The band's influence widened considerably with 1999's Clarity -- an album that has since emerged as a landmark of the emo genre -- but it was the follow-up, 2001's Bleed American, and the infectious single The Middle that broke them into the commercial rock mainstream. The emo label proved difficult to shake throughout the 2000s, even when subsequent Top Ten albums Futures (2004) and Chase This Light (2007) did little to evoke the hard-edged sensitivity of Clarity, but Jimmy Eat World still remained a league above the generation of genre torchbearers they helped spawn. Settling into comfortable veteran status in the 2010s, the band continued to issue reliable Top 20 efforts, rounding out the decade with their tenth album, 2019's Surviving.

            Jimmy Eat World formed during 1993 in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, Arizona.  (vocals/guitar) and Zach Lind (drums) met while attending Mountain View High School; years of playing in local bands had also introduced them to locals Tom Linton (guitar/vocals) and Mitch Porter (bass). The four musicians joined forces and derived the band's moniker from an argument between Linton's younger brothers, Ed and Jimmy. The two siblings were prone to fighting, with the heavyset Jimmy usually emerging as the victor. One day, a revengeful Ed resorted to drawing a picture of his heavyset older brother shoving the entire world into his mouth. The caption Jimmy Eat World was printed beneath, and the band deemed it a perfect fit. Citing influences like , early , , , and , Jimmy Eat World outfitted themselves as a punk rock act and began playing small shows in the Phoenix valley.
            
            Over the course of 1994 and early 1995, Jimmy Eat World released several EPs and singles on Wooden Blue Records, an imprint based in the nearby town of Tempe. Limited-edition pressings of One, Two, Three, Four, Back from the Dead Mother Fucker, and split EPs with , , and  would later run out of print, as would the band's self-titled debut album. Their audience was steadily growing, and  responded by signing Jimmy Eat World in mid-1995, when bandleaders  and Linton were only 19 years old. Porter soon exited the group; Linton's best mate since seventh grade, bassist Rick Burch, was enlisted as a replacement, and the band marked their major-label debut with the release of 1996's Static Prevails.
            
            Three years passed; by 1999, Jimmy Eat World had officially transformed themselves into an emo outfit with the release of their intricate sophomore album, Clarity. The record marked ' first time as the group's lead singer and principal songwriter, two roles that Linton had previously handled. Unfortunately,  had also experienced some significant changes, ultimately culminating in the departure of president Gary Gersh -- the same man who signed Jimmy Eat World in 1995. 's new management balked at Clarity's sensitive sound and started to shelve the album; it wasn't until several key radio stations (including L.A.'s influential KROQ) started airing the song Lucky Denver Mint that the label relented and released Clarity in February 1999. Lucky Denver Mint proved to be popular on the radio and in the movies, where it scored a spot in the Drew Barrymore comedy Never Been Kissed. Jimmy Eat World's fan base continued to grow, but their relationship with  progressively soured. After the label shelved the band's third LP, Jimmy Eat World decided to leave the label, and  was happy to let them go.
            
            Meanwhile, Jimmy Eat World's music was attracting an audience overseas, where Clarity had become a hit in countries like Germany. The band responded by financing and promoting a tour throughout the European continent. Singles, a collection of unreleased B-sides and rarities, was issued that same year on the independent label . A split EP with Australian rockers  was also released, and the group scraped together the profits from those ventures before entering the studio to record Bleed American (whose title would later be changed to Jimmy Eat World after the events of September 11, 2001). Enlisting the help of Clarity's producer, Mark Trombino, the band independently created the record that would effectively launch their high-profile careers. Jimmy Eat World then used the completed product to land a contract with , who released the album in July 2001. While the hard-hitting title track did moderately well, it was the record's second single, The Middle, that landed Jimmy Eat World a spot on the pop/rock map. Featuring a video filled with scantily clad teenagers, the song also enjoyed heavy exposure on MTV, where a younger audience latched onto the band's summery appeal. A year after its release, Jimmy Eat World was still a fixture on the Billboard charts and modern rock radio. A third single, Sweetness, was released in summer 2002, and A Praise Chorus followed soon after, allowing the album to go platinum.
            
            After the  label closed its doors in January 2004, Jimmy Eat World shifted their operations over to  for the release of their fifth album. Futures was released in October 2004 and debuted at number six on the Billboard charts, eventually going gold on the strength of the Top 40 hit Pain. The Stay on My Side Tonight EP appeared one year later, featuring a  cover and several tracks that had been axed from the Futures track list. Jimmy Eat World continued to tour in support of the album before entering the recording studio with  (, , ). With  behind the controls, Jimmy Eat World recorded their sixth studio LP, Chase This Light. The leadoff single, Big Casino, was released in August 2007, and the album followed in October. Before the release of their next record, the band embarked on a ten-year anniversary tour celebrating Clarity.
            
            In 2010, Jimmy Eat World issued their seventh album, Invented (), which saw the return of Trombino as producer. This release marked the first instance since their self-titled debut with original vocalist Linton taking over primary vocal duty (on Action Needs an Audience). Singer/songwriter  provided backing vocals for a handful of tracks on Invented and joined the band on tour. Damage () arrived in 2013, this time with  (, ) at the helm. The next year, the group took to the road once again to celebrate another milestone: the ten-year anniversary of Futures.
            
            The band's ninth album landed in late 2016. Produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen (, ), Integrity Blues featured the singles Get Right and Sure and Certain. Well-received, the record reached the Top 20 of the U.S. Billboard 200, and peaked at number four on the U.S. Alternative Albums chart. In 2019, Jimmy Eat World returned with their tenth set, Surviving, which was also produced by Meldal-Johnsen. More uptempo than Integrity Blues, the album dealt with themes of self-acceptance and sobriety, including tracks such as All the Way (Stay) and Congratulations, featuring vocals by  (, ). In 2022, the band issued the stand-alone singles Something Loud and Place Your Bets.
            
            The next year, the band toured the U.S. with . To promote the jaunt, they covered each other's songs, with Jimmy Eat World sharing their take on Telepath from 's The Million Masks of God (and the latter band tackling Table for Glasses from Clarity). ~ Andrew Leahey, Rovi">
